# CUDAassessmentProjectEtecube
This is a CUDA C++ Project developed by me for Etecube Company.
It is for a job interview, Software Engineering role.

This is my first CUDA project, also I learned everything about it while developing that project.

It is a small project that is about 100 athletes' race.
